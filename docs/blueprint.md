## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1E3A8A) to represent professionalism and trustworthiness, aligning with the corporate environment of EDSAFEST.
- Background color: Light gray (#F3F4F6), a subtle, desaturated complement to the primary dark blue, ensuring comfortable readability.
- Accent color: Purple (#7E57C2), an analogous color to dark blue that is slightly brighter and more saturated, for interactive elements and key highlights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for titles. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for content.
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent different categories within the trivia game. Icons should maintain a consistent style and use the primary and accent colors for emphasis.
- Employ a clean, modern layout with a focus on readability and ease of navigation. Use white space effectively to separate elements and reduce visual clutter. Prioritize key information, such as the question and timer, for immediate visibility.
- Incorporate subtle animations for feedback and transitions. For example, a small animation upon answering a question correctly, or a smooth transition between rounds. Avoid excessive or distracting animations.
